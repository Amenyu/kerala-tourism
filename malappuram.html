    <p>
        The hilly district of Malappuram falls among the northern districts in the state of Kerala. Closely bordered by the mountain ranges of the Western Ghats on its east, and flanked by the Arabian Sea on the West, Malappuram has an eventful history with the Zamorins of Kozhikode ruling the region for a significant period in the past. The district has also witnessed several local uprisings against the British rule, and was once a prominent center for Hindu-Vedic learning and Islamic philosophy. Historic monuments, natural attractions, ritual art forms, ethnic cuisine and age-old traditions make Malappuram a unique destination for travelers.

The District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) is set up with the purpose of fully exploiting the tourism potential of the State through sustained efforts by co-ordinating various Government departments, voluntary agencies and others interested in travel and tourism.

        <p class="card-text">Teak Museum is located 4 km from Nilambur, a town in the Malappuram district of Kerala, 
            South India. Teak occurs naturally in India with the main teak forests found in Kerala.

            In the old administrative records of the Madras Presidency, it is recorded that the most remarkable plantation
             owned by Government in the erstwhile Madras Presidency was the Teak plantation at Nilambur planted in 1844.
            
            The museum, a two-storey building, is the world's first teak museum and is operated by the Kerala Forest
             Research Institute. The exhibits include comprehensive information on aspects of the use of teak in their
              exhibits and articles on the subject. The museum provides extensive information of value historically, 
              artistically and scientifically.
            
            The museum was established in 1995 on the campus of the centre of Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) 
            because of the historical significance of teak to the area. The world's first teak plantation was planted in 
            Nilambur in the 1840s by the British.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Situated near the district collectorate in Malappuram, Kottakkunnu, is a recently developed tourist spot in the district. Kottakkunnu derives its name from an old fort, which was built by the Zamorins of Kozhikode (in Malayalam kotta means fort and kunnu means hill). One can still find here traces of this fort.

            The Municipality of Malappuram City has started Kottakkunnu Amusement park - a water theme park in the valley of Kottakunnu. Visitors are allowed up to 9 p.m. Nearby Kottakkunnu is the famous Vettakkorumakan temple and the Siva temple with several murals of Malabar.</p>
