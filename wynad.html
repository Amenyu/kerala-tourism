    <p>
        Wayanad  is an Indian district in the north-east of Kerala state with administrative
        headquarters at the municipality of Kalpetta. It is the only plateau in Kerala. The Wayanad Plateau forms
        a continuation of the Mysore Plateau, the southern portion of Deccan Plateau. It is set high in the Western
        Ghats with altitudes ranging from 700 to 2100 meters. Vellari Mala, a 2,240 m (7,349 ft) high peak situated
        on the trijunction of Wayanad, Malappuram, and Kozhikode districts, is the highest point in Wayanad district.
        The district was formed on 1 November 1980 as the 12th district in Kerala, by carving out areas from Kozhikode
        and Kannur districts. An area of 885.92 km2 of the district is forested.[8] Wayanad has three municipal 
        townsâ€”Kalpetta, Mananthavady and Sulthan Bathery. There are many indigenous tribes in this area.
        The Kabini River, a tributary of Kaveri River, originates at Wayanad. Wayanad district, along with the 
        Chaliyar valley in neighbouring Nilambur (Eastern Eranad region) in Malappuram district, is known for 
        natural gold fields, which are also seen in other parts of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Chaliyar river,
        which is the fourth longest river of Kerala, originates on the Wayanad plateau. The historically important 
        Edakkal Caves are located in Wayanad district.
    </p>
    <p>
        Wayanad district is bordered by Karnataka (Kodagu and Mysore districts) to the north and north-east, 
        Tamil Nadu (Nilgiris district) to the south-east, Malappuram to the south, Kozhikode to the south-west and Kannur 
        to the north-west. Pulpally in Wayanad boasts the only Lava-Kusha temple in Kerala and Vythiri has the only 
        mirror temple in Kerala, which is a Jain temple. Varambetta mosque is the oldest Muslim mosque of Wayanad. People
         of Wayanad live in absolute harmony with each other. Wayanad is famous for its role in the Cotiote War, where 
         Pazhassi Raja with the help of the Kurichya tribe in association with Hindus and Muslims of the Malabar region 
         launched a revolt against the British. Kaniyambetta and Muttil Panchayaths are the centrally located Panchayaths
          with the best access from all corners of Wayanad, while Tavinjal Panchayath is on the northeast border with 
          Kannur district. The edicts found in the caves of Ambukuthi Mala are evidence that occupation dates from the
           beginning of the New Age Civilisation.

The dam is also known as Kuttiyadi Augmentation Main Earthen Dam. The dam has a height of 38.5 metres (126 ft) and length of 685 metres (2,247 ft).

            In the dam's reservoir there is a set of islands that were formed when the reservoir submerged the surrounding areas.[2] The islands with the Banasura hills are in the background view.[3] It is the largest earth dam in India and the second largest of its kind in Asia. The dam is made up of massive stacks of stones and boulders.[4]</p>
